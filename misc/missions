Work :
- go up									: ok
- go down								: ok
- finish check play :
	- check if * is on the map_size 	: ok  - hard to test but
	- check if * is on adversary token 	: ok
- update chek_integrity for pieces like : ok
	**.
	..*

bug fix : algo seem weaker when go down,.
stuck on gnl in a case : 				: ok


- go cut								: ok
- go fill								:




Bugs :
map 00 -> doesnt go to the last 2
check play, has bugs? often miss


ideas :
- Parse during gnl, like :
 while gnl != 0 && ft_strcomp(line. <>) &&




Do a bitwise system to free. Or juste do wide free function which free if exist like I did with data->piece :
if (data->piece)
	free(data->piece)


si on met Ã§a en input : pointer being freed was not allocated
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug :

static void	ft_near_star_UL(t_data *data, int y, int x)
{
	char *star;
	int i;

	i = x;
	if (data->piece[y][x] != '*')
	{
		while (y >= 0 && star != NULL)
		{
			star = ft_strchr(data->piece[y--], '*');
		}
		y++;
		if (star != NULL)
		{
			while (x >= 0 && data->piece[y][x] != '*')
			{
				x--;
			}
		}
	}
		data->coo[0] = data->coo_me[0] - y;
		data->coo[1] = data->coo_me[1] - x;

}
